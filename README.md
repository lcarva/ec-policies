===========

[Rego][rego] policies related to the Enterprise Contract.


Getting started for developers
------------------------------

### Makefile

The [`Makefile`](Makefile) contains a lot of useful scripts and commands. Run
`make` by itself to see the help.

### Dependencies

Three tools are required, [`conftest`][conftest], [`opa`][opa], and [`gomplate`][gomplate].

You should be able to install them like this:

    make install-tools

If that doesn't work, installing them manually and making sure they're
available in your path should be fine.

An optional but useful tool for running tests while developing, (with `make
live-test`), is [`entr`][entr]. You can install it with `dnf`:

    sudo dnf install entr

And of course you need make if you don't have it already:

    sudo dnf install make

### Formatting

The rego files should be formatted using the standard format. To apply the
standard format run this before committing:

    make fmt

### Documentation

The documentation is built using [Antora][antora].

Those docs are published [here][docs].

To build the documentation locally:

    make docs-preview

### Running tests

From the top level directory you can run all tests and formatting checks, as
well as check that the docs are up to date, like this:

    make ci

You can run a single test like this:

    opa test . -r <test_name_matcher>

The `<test_name_matcher>` is a regex, so you can use it to run more than one
test.

See [`Makefile`](Makefile) for other ways to run the tests.

### Writing tests

Policies must have unit tests validating them.
All test files must adhere to the naming convention:

    file.rego
    file_test.rego

Refer to the [policy testing docs][testing] for more information.

The CI also enforces that there is 100% test coverage. If you're not at 100%
you can use this to show what lines of code are not covered:

    make coverage

### Running policies against real pipline run image build attestations

Fetch an image attestation from a registry:

    make fetch-att
    more input/input.json # to look at it

or:

    make fetch-att IMAGE=<some-image-with-an-attestation-ref>

Create a dummy policy config file:

    make dummy-config
    cat data/config.json # to look at it

Then to verify the build using the defined policies:

    make check-release

### Running policies against real pipeline definitions

For example to fetch a pipeline definition from your local cluster:

    make fetch-pipeline
    make fetch-pipeline PIPELINE=<some-pipeline-name>
    more input/input.json # to look at it

For a realistic Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline pipeline definition that
doesn't require cluster access, if you have the [build-definitions][builddefs]
repo checked out nearby you can do something like this:

    ( cd ../build-definitions && kustomize build pipelines/hacbs | yq 'select(document_index == 2)' -o json ) > input/input.json

Then to verify the pipeline definition using the defined policies:

    make check-pipeline


Policy bundles
--------------

The policies defined here are bundled and pushed as OCI artifacts using
`conftest`. There are three bundles, one for each of the release and pipeline
policies, and one for the data which is used by both.

The [push-bundles](.github/workflows/push-bundles.yml) automates creating and
pushing these bundles to [quay.io][quay], and generating a related PR in the
[infra-deployments repo][infradeployments] so the
latest bundles are used.

See also the [policy bundle documentation](./antora/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/policy_bundles.adoc).


Getting started for policy authors
----------------------------------

See the [Policy Authoring][authoring] documentation for guidance on
contributing to the definition of policy rules.
